3. ESC180: Intro Programming - Python
4. ESC103: Engineering Mathematics & Computation (Liner Algebra + Matlab)
5. CIV102: Structures and Materials - Civil Engineering with a famously stupid workload
6. ESC101: Praxis I: Engineering Design & Communications

This repository is made for personal use & public files for coursework. Maybe it could serve as a resource? Depends on just how much I can put up here.
